As an Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning Research Engineer at Universidade de SÃ£o Paulo I work to improve the security of Computer Vision Systems based on convolutional neural networks and apply them to real world applications.
The variety of systems existing today requires programming skills in C, C++ and Python, and mathematical and statistics proficience to deep understand them.
These skills, together with the most recent tools and libraries like TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, scikit-learn, enable me to research and develop new features for the existing computer vision system's and algorithms.
